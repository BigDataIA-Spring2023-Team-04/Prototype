The Multi-Purpose Chatbot is an application that allows you to perform different types of text analysis and generation tasks using the OpenAI API. You can use it to translate text, analyze sentiment, and generate new text based on a given prompt.

# Prerequisites
Before you can use the Multi-Purpose Chatbot, you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up for the OpenAI API at https://beta.openai.com/signup/. Once you have an API key, you can add it to the api_key variable in the code.

# Usage

# Translate: 
Enter the target language you want to translate the text to.

# Analyze Sentiment: 
This will analyze the sentiment of the text and give you a score from -1 to 1.

Enter a prompt for the model to generate text based on.

You can type exit at any time to quit the application.
